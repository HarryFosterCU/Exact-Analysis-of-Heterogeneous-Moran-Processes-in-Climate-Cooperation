This file contains the absorption matrix for the N=2 case of the Public Goods
Game with heterogeneous contributions. It corresponds to the state space:

[
[0,0],
[0,1],
[1,0],
[1,1]
]

With the row being which transitive state you begin in, and the collumn being
which absorbing state you end up in. The equations in this matrix are the full,
unsimplified expressions.
