This matrix represents the fixation probabilities for the N=3 case of the
Public Goods Game with heterogeneous contributions.

Collumn 1 represents the probability of full defection, collumn 2 represents
the probability of full cooperation. The rows represent which state the system
begins in, in the following order:

```
    [0,0,1],
    [0,1,0],
    [0,1,1],
    [1,0,0],
    [1,0,1],
    [1,1,0],
```

where 1 is cooperation and 0 is defection.

The equations within this matrix are in their simplified format
