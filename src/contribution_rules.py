def dirichlet_linear_alpha_rule(N):
    """
    Generates the alphas for a population contributing according to a linear
    rule in the dirichlet distribution. Each player's alpha is equal to their
    position in the state (indexed from 1). Therefore, as we take the mean
    across many realisations, we get that player i will contribute
    i * (contribution of player 1).

    Parameters
    -----------
    N - int, the number of players in a state

    returns
    ---------
    numpy.array - a linear counting from 1 to N."""

    Generates the alphas for a population contributing according to a binomial
    rule in the dirichlet distribution. We have a low alpha and a high alpha. n
    players contribute according to the low alpha, and N-n contribute according
    to the high alpha. These form two distinct sets of components for the
    vector obtained via the dirichlet distribution - those with a low mean and those with a high mean.

    Parameters
    -----------
    N - int, the number of players in a state

    n - int, the number of players who contribute according to the low alpha

    low_alpha - float, a strictly positive value for the low mean cooperators to
    contribute according to. Less than high_alpha.

    high_alpha - float, a strictly positive value for the high mean cooperators
    to contribute according to. Greater than low_alpha

def dirichlet_log_alpha_rule(N):
    """
    Generates the alphas for a population contributing according to a
    logarithmic transformation of the linear alpha rule in the dirichlet
    distribution. Each player's alpha is equal to the natural log of their
    position in the state +1 (in order to ensure strict positivity among the
    alphas, since otherwise player 1 would have $\alpha = 0$). Therefore, as we
    take the mean across many realisations, we get a logarithmic scale where
    the mean contribution for each player is always greater than the last, but
    the difference decreases as N increases.

    Parameters
    -----------
    N - int, the number of players in a state

    returns
    ---------
    numpy.array - the alpha value of each player according to their index. ."""
