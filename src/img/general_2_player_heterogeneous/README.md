We consider a 2-player population playing a public goods game.
We have $\alpha_2 = d \alpha_1$ for some $d \in (0, 10)$.
These graphs show the absorption probability for full cooperation ($rho_{C,C}$) for various
$\alpha$ values when player 1 is already contributing.
We parameterise this with $d$, and show how different values of $d$ affect the
absorption probability
