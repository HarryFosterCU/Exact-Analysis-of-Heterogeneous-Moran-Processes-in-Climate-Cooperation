We consider a 2-player population playing a public goods game.
Player 1 contributes $\alpha$. Player 2 contributes $d\alpha$ for some $d \in
(0,2)$.
These graphs show the absorption probability for full cooperation for various
$\alpha$ values when player 1 is already contributing.
We parameterise this with $d$, and show how different values of $d$ affect the
absorption probability
